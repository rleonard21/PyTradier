# PyTradier (Stale)

PyTradier is a library for interacting with the Tradier.com API for market data, company information, and trading actions through their brokerage. Most of the API is covered and is functional, but I am no longer working on this project.

Documentation for this library is hosted by RTD: https://pytradier.readthedocs.io/
